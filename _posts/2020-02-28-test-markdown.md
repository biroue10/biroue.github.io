I am Biroue Technician in computer systems and networks in a call center based in Casablanca. I'm going to talk to you today about my transition from the field of computer systems and networks to computer development. This transition was motivated by several factors, including the desire to be free from geographical constraints. Having suffered the brunt of the consequences of Covid-19, I found myself overnight, like most workers, confined to my home. Here is the starting point of this initiative. The idea that I could find myself overnight without a job was a significant risk, to which an adequate response would have to be found. Of course, the confinement was over, but the specter of dismissal or confinement still tormented my mind. So with this in mind, I started looking for an interesting Bootcamp that could provide me with development skills as quickly as possible. Since that date my quest for a Bootcamp was unsuccessful, it was only last August that I discovered ALX which is a pan-African initiative funded by the MasterCard foundation which aims to train young Africans in several areas among which we have software engineering. You can check this site for more details.
The software engineering course offered by ALX is so fascinating that I had to resign from my technician position to devote myself to it full-time. Of course, many will think it's a silly idea, at one point, I thought so, but in the end, I told myself that the sacrifice is worth it. The course is really tight (70 hours per week) that it was literally impossible for me to combine it with my work. The choice was therefore quickly made.
